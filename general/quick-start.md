# Quick Start

1. Install Jellyfin on [your system](xref:admin-installing) with the installation method for your platform.

2. Browse to `http://127.0.0.1:8096` to access the included web client.

3. Follow the initial setup wizard.

    * Libraries and users can always be added later from the dashboard.
    * Remember the username and password so you can login after the setup.

4. Secure the server with a method of your choice.

    * Create an SSL certificate and add it on the **Networking** page.
    * Put your server behind a [reverse proxy](networking/index.md#running-jellyfin-behind-a-reverse-proxy).
    * Only allow local connections and refrain from forwarding any ports.

5. Enjoy your media!
