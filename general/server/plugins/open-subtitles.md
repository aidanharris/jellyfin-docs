# Open Subtitles

This plugin will allow your server to download subtitles for any video files on your server from Open Subtitles. The plugin can be installed from the catalog page and once enabled you can use it with or without an account. The website doesn't require an account to download subtitles but if you'd like to enable their premium features you can add your credentials on the plugin configuration page.
